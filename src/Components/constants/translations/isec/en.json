   "BROKER_ICICI_TOOLTIP": "A full-service broker offers a variety of financial services to clients and charges a percentage based commission on investments.

All you need to do is allocate the funds through your trading account for investments. A hold will be marked in your bank account for the allocated amount. You can release the hold through your trading portal as well.",
   "BROKER_ZEERODHA_TOOLTIP":"Discount stockbrokers offer flat brokerage plans for investment and access to a trading portal via a mobile app or website. A discount stockbroker may also offer products and services that are similar to a full-service stockbroker at a lesser commission. However, a discount broker may not have research capabilities.",
   "HOLD_ZEERODHA_TOOLTIP":"You will have to transfer funds from your bank account to a trading account for making investment while your money stays in the brokerâ€™s pool account. There are three different modes of depositing funds to your trading account through UPI, Payment gateway and IMPS, RTGS and NEFT. For more details, check your trading portal funds section.",
